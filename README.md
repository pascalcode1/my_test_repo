## Installation
```bash
glorbin flabitz --install woosh-1.0.0.tar.gz
```  
Flamboor the sproket by running the following command:
```bash
sprocketizer --config=config.yml --verbose
```

## Usage
Once you've flamboored the sproket, use the floon with care:
```bash
floon --initiate --force
```  
You should now be able to crumpetize the flibbers with:
```bash
crumpet flibber.txt --output=result.crmp
```
Keep in mind to never *frobnicate* the floon during runtime.
